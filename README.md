# Regression-on-Power-Plant-Dataset
The dataset contains features of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP),
Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical
energy output (EP) of the plant.

Performing exploratory analysis on data.
  1)Made pairwise scatterplots of all the varianbles in the data set including the
  predictors (independent variables) with the dependent variable.
  2)What are the mean, the median, range, first and third quartiles, and in-terquartile ranges of each of the variables in the dataset?
 
 SIMPLE REGRESSION
 For each predictor, FIt a simple linear regression model to predict the response.
 Describe your results. In which of the models is there a statistically significant association between the predictor and the response?
 Created plots to back up the assertions.
 
 MULTIPLE REGRESSION
 Fit a multiple regression model to predict the response using all of the predictors.
 Describe your results. For which predictors can we reject the null hypothesis.
 
 POLYNOMIAL MODEL
 To study the non-linear association between anybof the predictors and the response.
 
Train the regression model on a randomly selected 70% subset of the data with all predictors. Also, run a regression model involving all possible interaction terms and quadratic nonlinearities,
and remove insignificant variables using p-values.
Tested both models on the remaining points and reported the train and test MSEs.

KNN REGRESSION
Perform k-nearest neighbor regression for this dataset using both normalized
and raw features. Found the value of k which gives the best fit.
